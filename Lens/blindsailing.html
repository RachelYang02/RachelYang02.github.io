						<h0>blind sailing</h0>
						<p>under the advisement of Alexander Morrow, John Geddes, and Paul Ruvolo, our team researched and developed a system that would allow blind sailors to
							 race one-on-one without needing a sighted guide on board. this was the third summer of this project, but the first summer focused on blind match racing.
							 our overall, ongoing mission is to replace the outdated Homerus system with something cheaper, smaller, and easier to use. specifically, our main focus
							 was improving the tack sensor.</p>

						<p>I also spent the summer trying to improve my documenting skills. you can view some videos from this past summer at my

							<h2>COMMUNITY BOATING, BOSTON</h2>
							<p>we spent most of our summer testing, prototyping, collecting feedback, and sailing at a public sailing center located along the Charles River.</p>

							<h2>HOMERUS</h2>
							<p>a 30-year old system, Homerus depends on using sirens and auditory cues to alert sailors information such as the other boat's location, their tack,
								 and where the course is. main pain points include: timely + frustrating set-up, tiny + fragile parts, heavy weight, expensive cost, overwhelming sensory
								 overload.</p>

							<h2>USER-ORIENTED DESIGN</h2>
							<p>we would test, even on the water, with goggles that simulated visual impairment or with blindfolds to help us relate to our users. we also frequently
								 tested our iterative prototypes with the blind sailors and continuously collected their feedback. </p>

							<h2>PROTOTYPE ONE</h2>
							<p>in the beginning, we focused on running experiments on land, in a clear + open field. at this point, our system was a lot smaller and easier to
								 tranport than the Homerus system, yet there was no high priority on packaging it cleanly.</p>

							<h2>SAILING</h2>
							<p>not only was it important to include the blind sailors in our process for feedback, but it was also key that we got our sea legs. we needed to know
								 what it was like out there on the water, so at least once a week we'd head out to the Charles to sail. this gave us insight when designing our system,
								 but more importantly it helped us understand the passion and fervor for sailing our users had, and why they had this sense of urgency for an improved
								 version of the Homerus system. </p>

							<h2>RASPBERRY PI</h2>
							<p>at the heart of our system lies two raspberry pi's that communicate to each other over an established wireless network. </p>

							<h2>USER INTERFACE</h2>
							<p>we implemented a keypad interface that has separate "modes," one for setting up the course or race, another for customization, and a final one for
								 sailing. when you press a key, text-to-speech relays what that key's function is, and you simply press again to select. we included straps so that the
								 blind sailors can attach it to their arm or leg, which frees their hands during racing. </p>

							<h2>TACK SENSOR</h2>
							<p>the Homerus system's tack sensor was based off of an unreliable tilt sensor. we went with a more accurate method to calculate which tack the boat is
								 on: a potentiometer that measures the angle between the boom and the mast of the boat, encased in customizable 3D-printed parts.</p>

							<h2>WATERPROOF PACKAGING</h2>
							<p>it was vital that our system could survive out on the water; and so, we used a waterproof box. as you can see, this system is much more convenient to
								 carry around than the Homerus system. overall, it includes a keypad, a tack sensor, a speaker (which can be substituted for wireless earphones), a
								 portable battery pack, a raspberry pi, and a GPS sensor.</p>

							<h2>ON-THE-WATER TESTING</h2>
							<p>by the end of the summer, we were able to test our system out on the water, with the blind sailors. these tests were usually successful, but if they
								 weren't on any particular day, we came back to our lab with beneficial information as to what to improve for the next time.</p>

							<h2>TO BE CONTINUED</h2>
							<p>though the summer is over, this project still has a ways to go. two of our team members are continuing their research into the fall, and more people
								 will be contributing to this project in the years to come. we hope to have a system released to the public in the near, near future. special thanks to
								 the amazing, dedicated, inspiring, welcoming, and patient blind sailors we were fortunate enough to work with. </p>
