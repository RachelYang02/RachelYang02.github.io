						<h3>sandwich composite pennyboards</h3>
						<p>within the scope of our materials science course, my team studied sandwich composites to determine which core material is best to construct pennyboards.
							 an expansion on a previous project, we wanted to see which material -- delrin, acrylic, hardboard, and MDF, to name a few -- worked best through multiple
							 fabrication processes. from this, we then built our own pennyboards, with which we'll use to ride around campus!
						<p>check out our final poster <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B4VehpWOFSnUVWVFZWc0RS10N1k/view?usp=sharing">here</a>.</p>

							<h2>LASERCUTTING</h2>
							<p>we came in with a larger matrix of materials to test, including aluminum, cardboard, and foamcore. through lasercutting, we had to eliminate many of these
								 potential contenders because of their incompatibility with the lasercutter. we lasercut 20cm by 4cm test coupons with the Epilog Helix Legend.</p>

							<h2>COMPOSITE LAYUPS</h2>
							<p>we epoxied our coupons with TOTAL BOAT Epoxy Resin and TOTAL BOAT fast hardener, as well as with fiberglass. the coupons that were epoxied with fiberglass
								 needed to be bandsawed out of their sheets.</p>

							<h2>TEST COUPONS</h2>
							<p>for the 3-point bend test, we prepared both "bare core" test coupons and "fiberglass + core" test coupons. </p>

							<h2>CONSISTENCY</h2>
							<p>since we had three or four coupons for each material to test, we wanted to ensure consistency by measuring each coupon's average thickness and weight. </p>

							<h2>3-POINT BEND TEST</h2>
							<p>we used a test scenario of 4mm/min extension and an end-of-test scenario with a 40% load drop of a 100 N load. this test allows us to measure modulus of
								 elasticity, flexural stress, flexural strain, etc. most of the plastics fractured by delamination, and the hardboard and MDF had the highest yield points.
								 acrylic's performance drastically improved with the addition of fiberglass, more so than with any other material.</p>

							<h2>FINAL PENNYBOARDS</h2>
							<p>with three members, we wanted three pennyboards. we chose to make two out of MDF since it performed so well across the board in each of the fabrication
								 processes, as well as in the 3-point bend tests. we also chose to make one out of acrylic, more for cosmetic purposes than functional.</p>
